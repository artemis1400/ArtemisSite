                <h2>Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am Art3mis from Georgia. I am really interested in Computers, especially in programming languages (software engineering). I love geography and chess. I speak English and Georgian fluently. Currently expanding my linguistic toolkit: German, Russian and little Japanese and Polish. If you wish to <a href='contact.html' class='bold'>contact and reach out to me</a> (pls do cuz of lack of friends) please message me on <a href='contact.html' class='bold'>discord</a>. Other soc messages? Not my thing. <a href='contact.html' class='bold'>Discord</a> is the way.</p>
                <p>P.S: This website yet to be done and does not involve my real GitHub profile</p>
